                            <hr>
				<p>I've really gotten into ASCII art recently and am actively pursuing learning how to build games.  <br>
					<p> During Diwali 2024, instead of helping my mom make rangoli, I made an app that inputs two emojis and outputs an emoji rangoli pattern. 
					Here's the link to it: <a href = "https://emorangoli.netlify.app" target='_blank'>Emorangoli</a>.<br>
					<p> Just last week, in 2025, I made my very first working game: Geobattle. You have to type out country names in title case before the computer. 
					You are Ukraine, while the computer is Russia. Whoever types the most country names within a minute, wins! 
					Link to the game:<a href ="https://aadra.github.io/geobattle">Geobattle</a><br>
					<p>I along with a colleague built this webcam rock-paper-scissors game that allows the user to use a punch gesture instead of 
						the traditional rock gesture. Here's the link to the game:<a href ="https://rps-frontend-tawny.vercel.app/">Webcam-RPS</a><br>
