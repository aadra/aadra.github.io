		<h3> Research Summary</h3>
		
		<p> During the course of her study at IIT Kharagpur, Aadra interned at the Unilever Research Centre and the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad where she worked on waste reduction along the food supply chain and the Public Distribution System. She spent the last year working with the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation, as a Senior Research Fellow on the Multi-country research consortium <a href = "http://lansasouthasia.org/content/public-and-private-actions" target='_blank'>Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA)</a>. She identified the most effective interventions by which the functioning of value chains could be enhanced for greater nutritional impact and designed the conceptual framework for analyzing the interventions across gender and fragility crosscuts. She engaged with project research partners at BRAC (Bangladesh) and IDS (UK). At graduate school, Aadra seeks to pursue her interest in the role of innovation and climate change toward sustainable agricultural development. She can speak in English, Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and Spanish.
